    "# Bayesian Optimization from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The general setting of an optimization problem is that we have a certain objective function $f(x)$ that we want to maximize. Mathematicallly, we are interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{*} = \\arg \\max_{x \\in X} f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is often a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. We consider a particular case of optimization problem: we have no analytical expression for the function of our interest $f$ and we cannot also compute the gradient with respect of $x$. Therefore we cannot use usual methods like gradient ascent (or gradient descent on $-f(x)$) to find the maximum. We are assuming a *black box* function $f$, that means, we can only evaluate the function at any query point $x$ in the domain. In other words we can observe the function $f$ only through unbiased and noisy observations $y$. In addition to that, evaluating the unknown function is expensive, either in term of computation or time, and we have only a limited budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we have seen that when we are dealing with these kinds of functions, Bayesian Optimization is a powerful sequential strategy to find the maximum/minimum. It has two main ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A probabilistic model over functions\n",
    "2. An acquisition function\n",
    "\n",
    "As probabilistic model, we are going to use a Gaussian Process. We need two functions, that you have also seen in the previous exercise session. One function `fit_predictive_gp` that fits the Gaussian Process and one function `optimize_gp_hyperparameters` that finds the value of lengthscale, output variance, and noise variance that maximize the log-likelihood plus the log prior. We will provide these functions (with comments) for you. We are also providing the code for the dataset of the last lecture to show you that the functions works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should implement a function that fit a Gaussian Process (following the algorithm in the lecture) `fit_predictive_GP(X, y, Xtest, lengthscale, kernel_variance, noise_variance)` (you should also reimplement the squared exponential kernel).  <font color='Green'>( Note that we are already giving you a function that optimizes the hyperparameters of the kernel. It is done in PyTorch using Gradient Descent. Also note, that this is is not the way that the Bayesian Optimization library implements this.) \n",

You only know that it is defined in $[0,2]$, ans you can query it using the followiong function `query_the_objective(x)`, which get as input the point $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ that has to be evaluated. In addition to that, it has also a function to plot the real function, but you should use it only at the end, which is `plot_the_unknown_function()`. To compare the result you obtain, you can ask the \"true\" max by calling the function `get_the_true_max()`, which return both the value of $x$ and of $f(x)$. Notice that we test the algorithm with `np.random.seed(32)`.
